# Javascript Challenge
All code relating to the Javascript challenge can be found in the ['javascript'](https://github.com/jbmilgrom/3lft/blob/master/javascript) folder. Please feel free to fork and run ['./javascript/index.html'](https://github.com/jbmilgrom/3lft/blob/master/javascript/index.html) in your browser. Doing so will trigger a call to `asyncCaller()`, the custom function for calling a single callback on data returned from a variable amount of asynchronous functions. Running ['./javascript/index.html'](https://github.com/jbmilgrom/3lft/blob/master/javascript/index.html) in your browser will also trigger [the testing suite](https://github.com/jbmilgrom/3lft/blob/master/javascript/test.js): `function assert(value, desc)`. Below is a snapshot of the page that results. In this case, 5 of the mock asynchronous functions and the mock callback were passed to `asyncCaller` i.e. `asyncCaller(callback, getUserInfo, getUserInfo, getUserInfo, getUserInfo, getUserInfo)`:

##### A little explanation of how asyncCaller(callback, async, async, async, etc.) works...

An empty array literal `var results` is initially created. An anonymous function is then passed to each async function, which updates `results` via `.push()` with data unique to each async function. `results` is accessible and manipulatable inside each async function (despite being called asynchronously) because of the closure formed in `asyncCaller()`'s signature, enabling `results` to serve as the cache of data returned by the async functions.  When the number of values stored in `results`, i.e. `results.length`, equals the number of async functions initially passed to `asyncCaller()`, i.e. `Array.prototype.splice.call(arguments, 1).length`, the callback passed as the first parameter to `asyncCaller()` is called, now with a fully complete `results` array: `callback(results)`.

# HTML/CSS Challenge

All code relating to the HTML/CSS challenge can be found in the ['html_css'](https://github.com/jbmilgrom/3lft/tree/master/html_css) folder. Please feel free to fork and run ['./html_css/index.html'](https://github.com/jbmilgrom/3lft/blob/master/html_css/index.html) in your browser. Here's a snapshot of the page that results:

##### A little bit about how the page was built...

Sass was used to precompile css because of the organizational and value storage benefits. As a result, reviewing [the .scss file](https://github.com/jbmilgrom/3lft/blob/master/html_css/stylesheets/mystyles.css.scss) over the raw .css file will probably give you more insight into how the code was designed. The html page is responsive down to 800px. Other than with respect to the checkbox section, this was achieved by making use of percentages and fluid widths. I purposely hard-coded (in pxs) the size of the checkbox section, however, so its width (and that of its internal components) stays constant as the window size decreases. This seemed like the right thing to do given the size of the checkboxes and corresponding labels when compared to the width of the full-sized window (and to better conform to the picture mock-up of the form presented in the prompt), but as a result, an @media query is required to make the checkbox section amenable to window widths below 1000px. That is not to say that the internal components of the checkbox section are not fluid as well. The 3 column effect results only from assigned percentages (and a left float) rather than any hard-coding of such a 3-column effect. As a result, a checkbox section that is fluid and spans the width of a full-sized window is readily obtained with a few adjustments if so desired.
