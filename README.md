# Javascript Challenge
All code relating to the Javascript challenge can be found in the 'javascript' folder. Please feel free to fork and run './javascript/index.html'. Doing so will trigger a call to asyncCaller(), the custom function for calling a single callback on data returned from a variable amount of asyncronous functions. Loading './javascript/index.html' will also trigger the testing suite: function assert(value, desc). This function's signature can be found in './javascript/test.js'. 

##### A little explanation of how asyncCaller(callback, async, async, async, etc.) works...

An empty array literal `var results` is initially created. An anonymous function is then passed to each async function that refers back to `results`, updating `results` via `results.push()` with data unique to each async function upon the calling thereof. 'results' is accessible and manipulatable inside each async function (despite being called asyncronously) because of the closure formed in `asyncCaller()`'s signature, which allows `results` to serve as the cache of data returned by the async functions.  When the number of values - `results.length` - stored in `results` equals the number of async functions - `Array.prototype.splice.call(arguments, 1).length` - initially passed to asyncCaller(), the callback (passed as the first parameter to `asyncCaller()`) is called, now with a full `results` array: `callback(results)`.
